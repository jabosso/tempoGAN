Creating a 256x256x256x3 grid (3D 256-resolution RGB scene) generates too much data for our laptops to manage.

For example we normally save 4 types of files: density_high, density_low, velocity, vorticity.
A 2D rendered frame with resolution 64 generates a density_low file of 626.2 Kb.
A 3D rendered frame with resolution 256 generates a velocity_high file having 179.4 Mb

With those settings generating 200 frames in 2-D and saving each frame would take around 290 Mb of space in 7 seconds.
For 200 fames in 3-D would take around 104 Gb of disk space (tests done had generated 5 frames on 2.6 Gb of disk). Besides of that, it took 35 minutes to generate 5 frames.

With that being said, we'll finish the super-resolution computation with GAN on the simpleplume example and render the newscene only with mantaflow.
